====== (This function is part of SDL_mixer, a separate library from SDL.) ======
= Mix_VolumeChunk =

Set the volume for a specific chunk.

== Syntax ==

<syntaxhighlight lang='c'>
int Mix_VolumeChunk(Mix_Chunk *chunk, int volume);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Function Parameters ==

{|
|'''channel'''
|pointer to the a specific instance of a sound.
|-
|'''volume'''
|the new volume, between 0 and [[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]], or -1 to query.
|}

== Return Value ==

Returns the previous volume. If the specified volume is -1, this returns
the current volume. If <code>chunk</code> is NULL, this returns -1.

== Remarks ==

In addition to channels having a volume setting, individual chunks also
maintain a separate volume. This lets an app adjust the
volume for all channels of a specific instance of that sound.

The volume must be between 0 (silence) and [[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]] (full
volume). Note that [[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]] is 128. Values greater than
[[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]] are clamped to [[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]].

Specifying a negative volume will not change the current volume; as such,
this can be used to query the current volume without making changes, as
this function returns the previous (in this case, still-current) value.

The default volume for a chunk is [[MIX_MAX_VOLUME]] (no attenuation).

== Version ==

This function is available since SDL_mixer 2.0.0.
